## VISION
We would like to improve the skiers experience merging together technology and nature. The goal is to collect data about the slope conditions in order to create an app which offers the skiers the necessary information to enjoy at most their snow adventure. We will like to become the landmark of the Alto Adige skiers and then expand our boundaries.

## Problem: a lot of different apps for different services
When skiers want to go skiing, they first have to check the weather conditions, which slopes are opened in the area where they are, the snow quality and so on. In order to find all this information, skiers need to visit a lot different web sites or to download various apps. All this takes time and annoys the skiers because it subtracts time that could be spent having fun in the snow. 

## Solution: Sky-Easy
The solution to all this waste of time is Sky-Easy, the app that skiers have dreamt of without knowing it. Sky-Easy is an all-in-one app that collects all the data that a skier need when he/she wants to spend time in the snow.  From now on skiers will not need to consults lots of different apps and websites to find all the information they need: they will just have to download one app: Sky-Easy.
